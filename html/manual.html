		SpaceZero is a Real Time Strategy 2D space combat game
		for a single or two players over a network.
		
		<br>
		  Your objective is to conquer all space.
		<p>
		  At the starting point the player owns a spaceship which has
		  landed on a planet.
		  
		<p>
		  Your first task is to acquire new spaceships and
		  find new planets in the Galaxy.
		<p>
		  By pressing key "o", a command menu will be displayed
		  at the bottom of the main window. You can buy towers
		  to extract resources and get more gold, explorers and
		  fighters to explore and conquer the Galaxy.
		<p>
		  After selecting an order press "ENTER" to
		  execute it.
		<p>
		  Press "ESC" to cancel it.
		<p>
		  Pressing any of the navigation spaceship keys (key
		  arrows and space bar by default) to control the
		  spaceship manually. Press the "down key arrow" to
		  return to automatic mode.
		<p>
		  In manual mode you can control every spaceship
                  independently.  To turn the spaceship right or left use
                  the arrow keys. In order to accelerate, use the up
                  key arrow. SPACE to fire.  "1", "2", "3", to change
                  weapon.
		<p>
		  By pressing key "M", a map of the known Universe
		  will be displayed.
		  <p>See <a href="#kcontrol">Keyboard control</a> for more options.

	  <h3>Manual and automatic mode:</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    You can change between both modes, for all your spaceships,
	    pressing any of the navigation spaceship keys (key arrows
	    and space bar by default) for manual mode and give an
	    order or press the "down arrow" key to go back to
	    automatic mode.<p>
	    
	  <p> Only one spaceship can be changed between these modes at a
	    time. Inside a planet this special spaceship is drawn with
	    white color. In the free space this spaceship is shown with
	    the radar centered on it.
	    
	  <p> In manual mode you can control every spaceship independently
	    with the keyboard. To turn the spaceship use the left and right
	    arrow keys. To accelerate, the up key arrow. SPACE to
	    fire. 1,2,3 to change armour.
	  <p>
	    In automatic mode, the spaceship follows your orders,
	    except in the following cases:
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li>If an enemy spaceship is near then attack.
	      <li>If it is close to asteroids, it will go towards them.
	      <li>If it has little fuel or no ammunition it will go to the
		nearest allied planet.
	      <li>When landed, it doesn't take off until it obtains a
		minimum amount of fuel and ammunition.
	    </ul>

	    When the exceptions finish, it will continue with the given
	    order.
	    
	   <p> Special orders:
	     <ul>
	  <li>STOP:<br>

	    If the spaceship is in outer space: stop, doesn't accelerate but can fire. <br>

	    Inside a planet: it first lands and stays on the ground, it doesn't take
            off but can fire. It never takes off.<br>

	    The order STOP is applied except in the following cases: 

	    <ul>
	    <li>if the spaceship has low ammunition, low fuel or is very
	    damaged it goes to the nearest allied planet.
	    </ul>

	    <li> RETREAT:<br> 
	      The spaceship will go directly to their destiny without
	      attack  enemies or asteroids.

	    <h3>Selecting a spaceship:</h3>
	    
	  <p>
	    There are several ways of selecting a spaceship:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Pressing the "Tab" key you can change
		between all your spaceships. "Ctrl-Tab" inverts
		the order.
	      <li>Pressing "PageDown" selects a spaceship in
		the next planet. "PageUp" in the
		previous one.
	      <li>Pressing "Home" selects the first
		spaceship in outer space.
	      <li>Using the order command SELECT and introducing
		the spaceship ID.
	      <li>With mouse. Left button selects the nearest spaceship to
	      mouse pointer. This selected spaceship can be inside a
	      planet.
	      <li>There are four rapid access keys to select spaceships:
		F1, F2, F3 and F4.  If you press Ctrl-F1 the
		actual selected spaceship is assigned to the key F1,
		etc...
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Selecting multiple spaceships:</h3>
	  <p>
	    You can select various spaceships with the mouse. The next
	    order will affect all of them. Simply, click with the left
	    mouse button and, without releasing it, drag and select
	    the region you want. All spaceships in this region will be
	    selected.
	  <p>
	    You can select multiple individual spaceships keeping the
	    "ctrl" key pressed.
	  <p>
	    If you select a planet in the map view, all spaceships
	    inside the planet will be selected.
	  <p>
	    The color of the selected spaceships will be grey.


	  <h3>Selecting a target:</h3>

	      <td>
		If the mouse pointer is close to a planet or one's own
		spaceship a red square signs the target objective. The right
		mouse button will send all selected spaceships to this
		target. This target can be a planet or any of your
		spaceships.<p>

		Over the mouse pointer is displayed: the space
		coordinates, the distance, in sectors from the
		selected spaceship to the mouse pointer and the id of the
		target.
		  
	      </td>

	    </tbody> </table>


	    <h3>Weapons:</h3>
	  <p>
	    The spaceships have three types of weapons.

		<td>Laser</td><td>Only fighters.</td>
	      </tr>
	      
	    </tbody></table>
	  <p>
	    Depending on the level of the spaceship some weapons are
	    available or not. At level 0 only the shots are
	    available. The fighter has two more weapons: missile at
	    level 1 and laser at level 2. All the spaceships increase their
	    weapons strength and their shields when they get a new
	    level.<br>

	    In manual mode you can change amongst the weapons pressing
	    1, 2 or 3 keys (If the weapon is available or it has
	    ammunition).
	  </p>


	  <h3>Defence satellites:</h3>
	  <table><tbody>

		In order to get defence satellites orbiting around
		your planets you must proceed as following: <br>
		<ul>
		<li>Buy some satellites (spaceships must be landed). <br>
		<li>Give them the ORBIT order. <br>
		<li>Once the spaceships are orbiting eject the satellites pressing &lt;Alt-s&gt;.
		</ul>  
		You can destroy the satellites selecting and giving them the order DESTROY.<br>
		All the satellites that are far away from a planet will be lost.

	  <h3>Repairing spaceships:</h3>

	  The spaceships are repaired, refueled and rearmed while are on
	  ground. <br>
	  In space, can be done little reparations. They obtain also some energy.
	  

	  <a name="experiencegold"></a>
	  <h3>Experience and Levels:</h3>
	  
	  Spaceships experience increase during the game. When a spaceship
	  reaches a maximum is upgraded to the next
	  level. This way it can get new arms, better defence
	  and more power. If a spaceship is upgraded, its state and
	  energy is restored to the maximum value.

	  <br><br>
	  The spaceships can get experience in any of the following ways:
	  
	  <p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>In combat</b>, when a spaceship is reached by a shot,
		destroying an enemy spaceship and conquering an enemy or
		empty planet.<br>
		
		When a spaceship conquer a planet there is a probability to
		received info from enemy (the coordinates of some
		planet). This probability increase with spaceship's level.
		
	      <li><b>Exploring</b>: Discovering new planets.
		
	      <li><b>Training</b>: all spaceships with a level equal or
		superior to 3 can train other spaceships. For training,
		both spaceships must be in same planet and the pupil must
		be landed. The master also must be two levels
		superior. The spaceship must be totally repaired.
	      <li><b>Trading</b>: Every time a Freighter complete a
	      trip increased it experience.
	      <li><b>Upgrade</b>: you can upgrade a spaceship (it cost
		gold). You can only upgrade until one level below the
		player level.
		
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h4>Player level:</h4> The player level is the maximum
	    level reached for one of your spaceships. The level of the
	    player will be increased only when the spaceship lands.
	    

	    
	    <h3>Gold:</h3>
	    
	    <h4>There are several ways to obtain gold:</h4>
	  <p>
	    -Every tower in each planet gets gold until the planet
	    resources are finished. In this case they can still
	    obtain a little amount of gold. Increasing the number
	    of towers in every planet increased the amount of gold
	    obtained. Depending on the planet mass, there is a
	    limit in the number of towers in the same planet that
	    can obtain gold. For the big ones, this limit can be
	    four or five towers. For the little ones, three.
	    
	  <p>
	    -For each planet, every player gets a fix amount of
	    gold.
	    
	  <p>
	    -Destroying asteroids is another way to obtain gold.
	  <p>
	    -Trading: when a Freighter spaceship reach a planet, the
	    planet resources are increased.
	    
	  <p>
	    -All the spaceships destroyed inside a planet increase the
	    planet resources.
	  <p>
	    -And the last way: selling spaceships .
	    
	  <p><br>
	    
	    <h4>And there are also several ways to lost it:</h4>
	    
	  <p>
	    -All the spaceships, except the towers, have a cost. This
	    constant cost is increased when a spaceship is upgraded.
	    
	  <p>
	    -All the ammunition cost gold.
	    
	  <p>
	    -Repair and refuel a spaceship cost gold.
	    
	  <p>
	    -Buying, upgrading spaceships. 
	    
	    
	    <h3>Exploring the Universe:</h3>



	    The explore skills depends on the level of the spaceship:
	    <ul> 
	      <li> level 0: a random walk. 
	      <li> level 1: try to find an unknown sector near their
		position. if there no one: random walk
	    
	      <li>level 2 and greater: looks for an unknown sector
		further than the previous level. If there no one: random
		walk
	    </ul> 

	    The explorers increase in one their skill value: an
	    explorer of level 0 has a level 1 on explorer skill. A
	    fighter of level 0 has a level 0 on explorer skill.


	    <h3>Size of the Universe:</h3>
	    
	    Its possible to choose the size of the Universe, the
	    number of galaxies and the total number of
	    planets. Use the command line options: -l, -g and
	    -n.<p>  The units of the universe size are pixels.
	    The distance is indicated in sectors (1 sector is 1410
	    pixels)
	    
	    <hr>	      
	    <a name="netgaming"></a>
	    <h3>Net gaming:</h3>
	    
	    For two players net game: one must be configured as
	    the server and the other one as the client. Use the
	    next command line options: <p>
	    
	    $ spacezero -s -ip ipnumber <br>
	    
	    for the server, and <br><br>
	    
	    $ spacezero -c -ip ipnumber <br>
	    
	    for the client. <p>
	    
	    where ipnumber is the IP number of the server.
	    
	  <p>
	    SpaceZero use the port 50100 by default. You can use
	    another port adding -port portnumber in the command
	    line. SpaceZero also use the next port, by default
	    50101.
	    
	    <hr>

	    <h3>Saving game options:</h3> By default the options are
	    saved when the game starts. A new game starts with the
	    previous game options.

	    <a name="loadsave"></a>
	    <h3>Loading and saving games:</h3>
	    
	    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-s and &lt;Ctrl&gt;-l will save and load a game. Only two
	    games can be saved: one for single games and another one for a net
	    games.
	    <br>In a net game only the server can save and load games.


	    <h3>Pausing a game:</h3>
	    
	    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-p will pause the game.
	    

	    <h3>Quitting a game:</h3>
	    
	    &lt;Ctrl&gt;-q will quit the game.
	    
	    <h3>Game Over:</h3>
	    
	    If you lost all your spaceships the game is over.
	  <p>
	    In queen mode game, if you lost the Queen Spaceship,
	    you lost the game.
	  <p>
	    When game is over, pressing the "f9" and
	    "f10" keys you can observe the other players
	    (in single games and in the server side).
	    
	    
	    
	    <h3>Tips:</h3>
	  <p>-Try to conquer all the inexplore planets as fast as
	    you can.
	  <p>-Don't buy more than two or three towers by planet
	    unless you need to defend the planet.</p>
	  <p>-Watch out your explorers, don't let them go too far.</p>
	  <p>-You can form groups of spaceships ordering to some of
	    them GOTO another spaceship. All of them will go where this
	    last one go.</p>
	  <p>-Save some gold. It would be useful if you are under attack.</p>
	  <p>-Use the spaceships of level three or superior to upgrade
	    the rest, especially the towers.</p>
